COMPLETED:

1(S)- Camera as child of sceneObject
1(V)- Childs of sceneObject
1(V)- Root as Singleton
1(S)- Input Abstraction Layer
1(V)- Merge md2Loader and md2File classes in the md2Interface
1(G)- Create unit units for testing
1(V)- Exit Bug (Memory Leak)
1(V)- Mutex Bug
1(S)- Clock Class (class is generic. You call updateFrame() for the clock instance that is keeping track of what you want, then query it anytime for fps or last frame delta)
	1(S)- fps counter with a sliding frame window (Window title now shows fps average over last 600 frames)
1(G+V)- Collada Loader
	1(V)- include the Collada in the AssetManager
1(V+G)- Asset Manager
	1(V)- make it Singleton
	1(G)- Texture Manager
		1(G)- MD5 hashing for checking that each file is loaded only once
	1(V)- Mesh Manager
		1(V+G) - MD2 Manager + MD5 hashing
		  1(V) - COLLADA Manager
					1(G)- MD5 hashing	
	1(V)- Mutex Manager
1(G)- Quaternions into Math Library
1(G)- Update boost test for quaternions
1(V)- A WindowManager capable of opening a window with an opengl context
	1(V)- WindowManager as Singleton
1(S)- Sound Manager
	1(S)- Sounds without movements freeze
