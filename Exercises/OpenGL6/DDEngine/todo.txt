COMPLETED:

1(S)- Camera as child of sceneObject
1(V)- Childs of sceneObject
1(V)- Root as Singleton
1(S)- Input Abstraction Layer
1(V)- Merge md2Loader and md2File classes in the md2Interface
1(G)- Create unit units for testing
1(V)- Exit Bug (Memory Leak)

1(S)- Clock Class (class is generic. You call updateFrame() for the clock instance that is keeping track of what you want, then query it anytime for fps or last frame delta)
	1(S)- fps counter with a sliding frame window (Window title now shows fps average over last 600 frames)
1(G+V)- Collada Loader
	1(V)- include the Collada in the AssetManager
	1(G+V)- multi-node collada Loader
1(V+G)- Asset Manager
	1(V)- make it Singleton
	1(G)- Texture Manager
		1(G)- MD5 hashing for checking that each file is loaded only once
	1(V)- Mesh Manager
		1(V) - MD2 Manager 
			1(G) - MD5 hashing
		1(V) - COLLADA Manager
			1(G)- MD5 hashing	
	1(V)- Mutex Manager
1(G)- Quaternions into Math Library
1(G)- Update boost test for quaternions
1(V)- A WindowManager capable of opening a window with an opengl context
	1(V)- WindowManager as Singleton
1(S)- Sound Manager
	1(S)- Sounds without movements freeze
	1(S)- fix wave file
	1(S)- migrate to OpenAL
1(V)- debug draw system
	1(V)- axis of rotation of an object via line draws
	1(V)- draw the bounding box or bounding sphere of an object
	1(V)- draw the name of the SceneNodes
1(G)- Quaternions for camera rotations
1(V)- DoubleCheck each Singleton for possible memory leak or performance optimization
1(G)- Physics SDK
	1(G)- Rewrite methods of the Transformation Class in order to work properly with physics
1(G)- Lighting System
1(G)- attach/detach camera to player model
1(V+G)- MD2 normals fixed enough
1(G)- Use Clock Class into updates/draws/synchs
1(G)- Compile everything we can as a DLL
1(G)- OpenMP utilization in for cycles
